# Leap Aquisition

A console application to record data from the Leap Motion Controller.

This application wraps the [Callback Example](https://developer.leapmotion.com/documentation/v4/callback-example.html)  in an interface, and allows for saving data in a .csv format. 

To implement this I reccomend replacing the following files in the examples provided in the LeapSDK, with those found in this repository. 

 1. CallbackSample.c
 2. ExampleConnection.c
 3. ExampleConnection.h


**TODO**

 - Comment on code
 - Fix spelling error in Callbacksample.c
 - Update Readme
 - Destory connection method doesn't work.
